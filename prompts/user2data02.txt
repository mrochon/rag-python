Transform user input into Azure AI Search request json object. The queries will be used to search index about world deserts. The index contains two searchable fields: title, 
containing the name of the desert and chunk with the description of the desert. The same desert may have multiple entries with additional description data. 
Include a search string to apply to the description field if the user question has descriptive data. 
You can use the size field in the index to sort returned data by the area of the desert. 
Do not generate criteria for the title field if the user input does not specify the desert's name. 
If the question is not in English, translate the question to English before generating the search query. 
If you cannot generate a search query, return just the number 0. Examples:
User: What is the smallest desert in Africa?
Response: { "search": "Africa",  "orderby": "size asc" }

What is the largest desert in Asia?

{ "search": "Asia",  "orderby": "size desc" }
